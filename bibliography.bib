The Toolbox is based on symbolic musical data but signal processing methods are applied to cover such aspects of musical behaviour as geometric representations and short-term memory. Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are suitable for contextdependent musical analysis, a prerequisite for many music information retrieval applications.},

@phdthesis{Marvin1988,
abstract = {This dissertation proposes the thesis that abstract theories of pitch- and set-class structure do not reflect listeners' aural perception of sounding music as effectively as theories modelling the articulation of these underlying structures on the musical surface. This position is supported by a review of pertinent music-theoretical and music-psychological research. Based upon the data collected by various music-psychologists, published elsewhere but compared and critiqued here, this study concludes that listeners generally use figural cues drawn from musical context --- for example, melodic shapes, changes of direction, relative durationnal patterns, and so on --- to retain and recognize musical ideas in short-term memory. These figural cues may be represented in precise notation and compared with one another by application and generalization of Robert Morris's contour theories. Morris's comparison matrix and contour equivalence relations are introduced here, followed by this author's generalization of the thwory to duration space and development of similarity relations for melodic contours of relative pitch height and rhythmic contours of relative suration successions. The similarity relations for musical contours build upon previous wort of Dabid Lewin, Robert Morris, and John Rahn. While the efficacy of these theories for modelling perceivable patterns in musical contexts cannot be proven without further psychological testing, their applicability to musical analysis is demonstrated. Analyses drawn form the music of Bartok, Webern, Berg, and Var\`{e}se illustrate ways in which melodic and rhythmic contour relationships may be used to shape a formal scheme to differentiate melody from accompaniment, to associate musical ideas that belong to different set classes, and to create unity throuth varied repetition. The concluding chapter explores avenues for future work. A section on music-psychological experimentation offers a critical overview of research in this area and proposes ideas for future experimentation. Second, the implications of music-psychological research for the pedagogy of non-tonal music theory are considered and a model curriculum for non-tonal music theory proposed. The dissertation concludes by proposing a number of ways in which contour theory might be generalized to other domains and illustrates the application of one such generalization to the analysis of chord spacing in a piano work of Luigi Dallapiccola.},

abstract = {This paper explores some formal aspects of contour, especially the mathematics of an abstract definition of contour itself. In the hope of establishing a general formulation that will be of use to more specific, style- and genre-related theoretical work in contour, a "non-stylistic" approach is taken. Specific musical situations (like the equivalence classes generated by elementary transformations, or musical assumptions made by ethnomusicological contour studies) are not invoked; Further generalization of the theory of "the number of possible contours" includes the formulation of a theory of contour for asymmetrical and non-ternary contour descriptions, one we believe to be of musical interest. We assume that contour may be applied to any parameter of music, at any hierarchical level. These ideas may be used in the analysis of waveforms, melody, the sequence of pitch means in some large-scale segmentation of a piece, or any other quantifiable parameter.},

@phdthesis{Sampaio2008,
abstract = {Contours can be understood as the shape or format of an object. In Music contour can represent a parameter in function of another, like pitch in function of density or density in function of amplitude. Contours are important because, as well as pitch sets and motives, they can help giving coherence to a musical piece. Theories of contours have been used in areas such as Ear Training and Analysis, but the systematic use of contours for generation of compositional material is an issue still lacking literature. In this thesis I present the piece "Em torno da rom\~{a}" [Around the pomegranate] and its analysis. This piece, for woodwind quintet, was composed using combinations of contour operations associated with parameters such as pitch, tempo, density and texture. In order to accomplish this task, I did a literature review of contour theories, I did a mapping of contours to musical elements, I composed studies of possibilities for experimentation with contours, I develop the Goiaba, a software to assist in processing contours for composition, and finally composed the piece "Em torno da rom\~{a}. This study helps to advance the state of art of contour theories through composition contour operations experiments using contour operations and contributes with new tools to the composition field. My conclusion is that contours can be used in a systematic way in musical composition, but we still need further study. Thus this depth and continuity in development of Goiaba are possible future activities resulting from this work.},
